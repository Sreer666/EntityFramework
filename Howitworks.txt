what is the use of DbContext and How it works?

Basicaly DbContext is instance of data base that can bridge between entity class or domain classes to database.
DbContext is primary class and it is responsible for intracting with database.

It is responsible for the following activities:

Querying: Converts LINQ-to-Entities queries to SQL query and sends them to the database.

Change Tracking: Keeps track of changes that occurred on the entities after querying from the database.

Persisting Data: Performs the Insert, Update and Delete operations to the database, based on entity states.

Caching: Provides first level caching by default. It stores the entities which have been retrieved during the life time of a context class.

Manage Relationship: Manages relationships using CSDL, MSL and SSDL in Db-First or Model-First approach, and using fluent API configurations in Code-First approach.

Object Materialization: Converts raw data from the database into entity objects.
